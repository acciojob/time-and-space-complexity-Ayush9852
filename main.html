	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

	<p>
		Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. In other words, it measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time. A more efficient algorithm has a lower time complexity, allowing it to execute faster, especially when dealing with larger inputs.
	</p>
	<p>
		Space Complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. It is often denoted by O(f(n)), where 'n' is the size of the input. One common notation is O(n), indicating that the space required by the algorithm grows linearly with the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial in optimizing memory usage, and understanding it helps in designing algorithms that use memory efficiently.
